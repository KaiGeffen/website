# About Arithmetic Circuits

[Arithmetic circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_circuit_complexity) consist of a collection of wires and gates, where the wires hold [elements of a finite field](about-finite-fields.md) and each gate computes either finite field addition or finite field multiplication.
In contrast, in an [electronic circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_circuit), the wires either contain electrical signal or they don't, and each gate may compute a variety of logical operations. 

Arithmetic circuits are central to zero-knowledge proof techniques: SNARKs and STARKs prove integrity of an execution of an arithmetic circuit. 

## Arithmetic Circuits as Polynomials
Because arithmetic circuits consist only of addition and multiplication, the circuit can be translated into a polynomial. In other words, the output(s) of the circuit can be expressed as a multi-variate polynomial, $C(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ where 
- $n$ is the number of inputs to the polynomial, and 
- the degree of $C$ is bounded by the number of multiplications in the circuit.

The circuit pictured above can be written as $C(x_1, x_2) = (x_1+x_2)\cdot x_2 \cdot (x_2+1)$. This simple example is drawn from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_circuit_complexity).
  
## RISC Zero's Circuits
RISC Zero has built a number of arithmetic circuits:
- a [RISC-V circuit](https://docs.rs/risc0-circuit-rv32im/latest/risc0_circuit_rv32im/), which emulates rv32im. 
The rv32im circuit receives a RISC-V binary and some user specified input, and generates an [execution trace](../explainers/proof-system/what_is_a_trace.md).
- a SHA-256 accelerator circuit, which is called by the rv32im circuit.
- a recursion circuit, which receives two receipts and produces a single recursion receipt. The recursion circuit accepts either two zkVM receipts or two recursion receipts. 

The [zkVM receipt](../explainers/proof-system/what_is_a_receipt.md) that proves the validity of the rv32im execution trace is generated by the [Prover](https://docs.rs/risc0-zkvm/latest/risc0_zkvm/prove/index.html) and verified by [receipt.verify](https://docs.rs/risc0-zkvm/latest/risc0_zkvm/receipt/struct.Receipt.html#method.verify).
