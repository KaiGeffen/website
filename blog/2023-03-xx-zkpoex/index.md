We are thrilled to share the recent success of a groundbreaking project, zkPoEX (Zero-Knowledge Proof of Exploit), which won 1st place in the ETHDenver Hackathon DeFi Track. 
[zkPoEX](https://github.com/zkoranges/zkPoEX) enables secure collaboration between security experts and DeFi projects.

Built using RISC Zero’s zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM), zkPoEX is an innovative Proof of Concept (PoC) that showcases a simple re-entrancy case; 
it's truly one of the most exciting applications of zero-knowledge technology in the DeFi landscape.

## The Challenge in DeFi Security

Bug bounty programs in the DeFi space can be challenging to manage and maintain. They aren't always honored, and compensation for white hat hackers may not be sufficient. 
This lack of incentive can lead to unreported vulnerabilities, ultimately resulting in a less secure DeFi ecosystem.

## Enter zkPoEX: A Game-Changing Solution

zkPoEX addresses these concerns by enabling white hat hackers to report live vulnerabilities in smart contracts while maintaining the confidentiality of the exploit. 
This could allow auditors to safely generate a zero-knowledge proof of exploit without revealing the actual exploit. 
With zero-knowledge proofs, the auditor can prove that they know of a transaction that can produce an undesirable change of state in certain contracts, without revealing the specifics of the exploit.

Consequently, projects are incentivized to collaborate with auditors to fix the vulnerability, fostering a stronger relationship between hackers and project owners. 
The result is a more secure DeFi ecosystem where vulnerabilities are addressed effectively and confidentially.

zkPoEX was developed by [@zkoranges](https://twitter.com/zkoranges) and [@feder.eth](https://twitter.com/feder_eth) with acknowledgements to Daniel Lumi for advisory and Maciej Zieliński for his insightful [blog post](https://odra.dev/blog/evm-at-risc0/) on EVM inside the RISC Zero zkVM. 

As zkPoEX's success in the ETHDenver hackathon DeFi track demonstrates, there is immense potential for zero-knowledge proof technology in securing the DeFi ecosystem. 

The RISC Zero zkVM, with its ability to facilitate the creation and verification of zero-knowledge proofs, is uniquely positioned to power such revolutionary applications like zkPoEX.

We, at RISC Zero, are committed to driving innovation in the field of zero-knowledge proof technology and expanding its use cases across industries. 
We look forward to contributing to the future of DeFi security and continuing our collaboration with projects like zkPoEX to ensure a safer and more robust financial ecosystem for everyone.

Stay tuned for more updates on the RISC Zero zkVM and its groundbreaking applications, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to explore collaboration opportunities.
